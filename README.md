## Golang Service Starter Kit Project

The Golang Service Starter Kit is designed to accelerate the development of
robust, scalable, and maintainable microservices using Go. This starter kit
provides a solid foundation, following best practices and a clean architecture,
to help developers kickstart their projects quickly and efficiently.

Key Features Modular Project Structure: The starter kit adopts a clean and
organized project structure, promoting separation of concerns and modularity.
This helps in maintaining and scaling the service as it grows.

- Configuration Management: Centralized configuration management using a simple
  and extensible approach, allowing easy integration of various configuration
  sources such as environment variables and configuration files.

- HTTP Server: A pre-configured HTTP server with graceful shutdown capabilities,
  middleware support, and essential handlers like health checks.

- Middleware: Built-in middleware for logging and recovery, ensuring robust
  error handling and request logging out-of-the-box.

- Dependency Injection: Utilizes dependency injection to manage service
  dependencies, improving testability and decoupling components.

- Repository Pattern: Implements the repository pattern for data access,
  providing a clean abstraction over different data sources like databases,
  APIs, and in-memory storage.

- Service Layer: A dedicated service layer to encapsulate business logic, making
  the codebase more maintainable and testable.
